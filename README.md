This repository contains the source code of my new demo DigitalGardens. This demo is intended as a proof-of-concept for a new type of commenting system that shows (dis)agreements through textual-heatmaps.  

If you have any feedback/comments/ideas to collaborate on, feel free to send me an email. For more information on how this webapp works, please see [this loom video](https://www.loom.com/share/90fc5545b1bb4cbd8d03de26e3b5920d?sid=c43fd7a1-984d-44c1-a148-0eb89ea9a715).

Note, if you want to run this webapp yourself you need to install `sentence-transformers` and `flask`.

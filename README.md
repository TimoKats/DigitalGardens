This repository contains the source code of my new demo DigitalGardens. This demo is intended as a proof-of-concept for a new type of commenting system that shows (dis)agreements through textual-heatmaps.  

If you have any feedback/comments/ideas to collaborate on, feel free to send me an email. For more information on how this webapp works, please see this loom video

Note, if you want to run this webapp yourself you need to install `sentence-transformers` and `flask`.
